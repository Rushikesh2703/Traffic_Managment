Urban traffic congestion has become a persistent challenge in rapidly growing cities worldwide. 
Traditional traffic signal systems rely on fixed-time control mechanisms, where red and green light durations are pre-set based on assumptions or historical patterns. 
These systems do not adapt to real-time changes in traffic volume or flow, making them inefficient in dynamically changing urban environments.

As a result:
High-traffic lanes remain blocked while low-traffic lanes receive unnecessary green signals.
Emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks face delays due to rigid signal sequences.
Commuters experience longer wait times, contributing to frustration, road rage, and missed deadlines.
Fuel consumption increases due to idling engines, leading to a rise in carbon emissions and environmental degradation.
Traffic personnel are overburdened, manually intervening in peak hours, which is both unsustainable and inconsistent.
Furthermore, in the absence of real-time monitoring and automation:
Traffic patterns during festivals, road blockages, or accidents cannot be accommodated efficiently.
Lack of vehicle prioritization (e.g., buses, ambulances) further worsens traffic dynamics and public safety.
In today's era of smart cities, real-time, adaptive, and intelligent traffic control is not just a convenience—it’s a necessity. 
There is a critical need for an AI-driven solution that can analyze live traffic conditions, automatically adjust signal timings, 
and respond to unforeseen scenarios—ultimately making our roads safer, greener, and more efficient.

AI Approach:
Object Detection (YOLOv8): Real-time detection and counting of vehicles from traffic camera feeds.
Adaptive Algorithms: Dynamically change signal timing based on vehicle density at intersections.
Automation Layer: Automatically syncs detected vehicle count with signal controller.
Fail-Safe Mechanism: Auto-switch to default timings in case of software/hardware failure.
 Architecture Overview:
Input Layer: CCTV cameras at traffic signals
Processing Layer: YOLOv8 model detects and counts vehicles from live feed
Decision Layer: Python-based logic adjusts red/green signal durations
Control Layer: Signals controlled based on real-time traffic density
Fallback System: Default timer system activated if AI fails
Tools & Technologies:
Languages: Python
Frameworks: YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy
Platforms: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
 Impact & Use Case:
Reduced Congestion: Smooth traffic flow using intelligent light control
Environmental Benefits: Less idle time means reduced CO₂ emissions and fuel usage
Safety Improvement: Minimizes chances of collisions at signals
Scalability: Can be applied to city-wide intersections
Future Scope:
Emergency vehicle priority detection (ambulance, fire truck)
Alert system for abnormal activity or congestion
Accuracy enhancement with larger datasets
Integration with IoT traffic monitoring systems
